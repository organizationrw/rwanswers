    <h4>What makes “real photo postcards” valuable to collectors?</h4>
    <p>Real photo postcards show scenes from small town America and give a sense of what life was like at that time. Furthermore, they are quite rare as only several hundred cards were produced of each photo.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What are some of the reasons why people collect postcards? Give three examples from the text.</h4>
    <p>People collect postcards to understand American history, as a financial investment, for the sake of collecting things, and because of an interest in the photos of “real photo postcards.”</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Why might young people not be as interested in collecting postcards as their elders? Use information from the text to support your answer.</h4>
    <p>Answers may vary and should be supported by the text. Students may argue that postcards were more popular with older generations as postcards such as “real photo postcards” were popular in the 20th century. Furthermore, technological trends reflect an interest among young people to document different aspects of their lives via Facebook photos and other social media tools as opposed to capturing them on postcards.</p>
